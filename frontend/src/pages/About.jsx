            Velvetyne was founded with a commitment to open collaboration and a bold vision to
            redefine type design through accessibility, creativity, and community. What began as an
            independent initiative to share experimental fonts has evolved into a globally
            recognized collective of passionate designers.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Since our beginnings, we've championed the power of open-source design by offering
            high-quality, unique typefaces that are free to use and adapt. Our fonts have been used
            in everything from editorial layouts and digital interfaces to bold branding projects
            and artistic experiments.

          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            At Velvetyne, we believe in democratizing design. Our mission is to foster a culture of
            sharing, experimentation, and typographic innovationâ€”empowering creatives everywhere to
            break boundaries and shape new visual languages.
